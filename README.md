*NEEDS UPDATING*
Data Description (#vars, #rows, types, etc):
* 1460 rows for train
* 1460 rows for test
* 79 variables

Problem we would like to solve with this data/ Data manipulations:
We would like to be able to accurately predict the prices of homes based off a variety of characteristics, while also creating aggregated variables based on factors such as building type, year built or remodeled, and so on. We will also create levels of variables (low, medium, high, etc) to create categories for predictors.

Algorithms to attempt:
* KNN-Clustering (dividing prices into bins)
* Linear Regression (for actual values)
* Logistic Regression (for low/high)
